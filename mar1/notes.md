# Math

## Refresher
Z - set of integers
Q - set of rational numbers
R - set of real numbers
F - a finite field
K - field of real or complex numbers
Z*p - finite field of integers mod p

Use fermat's little theorem to get multiplicative inverse in modular arithmetic

Groups have:
- Closure
- Associativity
- An identity element
- Inverse elements

Subgroup:
- A set of elements within a group that have the properties of a group

## Quadratic residue
x^2 = q mod p
q is the quadratic residue

## Cyclic Groups
A finite group can be cyclic.  If you start at any point and apply the group operation with a generator element repeatedly, you will go through every element in the group

## Finite Fields
There is a finite set of elements
The *order* of a field is the number of elements in the set.
