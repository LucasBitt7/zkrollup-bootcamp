# Introductory Math

- The set or Integers is denoted by Z e.g. {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
- The set of Rational Numbers is denoted by Q e.g. {... 1, 3/2, 2, ...}
- The set of Real Numbers is denoted by R e.g. {2, sqrt(2), pi,}
- Fields are denoted by:
  - F for finite field
  - K for real/complex
  - Z*p for finite field of integers mod p

## Modular Arithmetic
- There's a max number and it wraps around
- Think about it like a clock
- n mod k = remainder of n / k

## Inverses
The inverse (i) of k satisfies the following:
i * k = 1

From Fermat's little theorem:

## Equivalence Class
6 mod 7 = 6
13 mod 7 = 6
20 mod 7 = 6

These form an  equivalence class

## Group theory
A group has
- A set of elements (G)
- A binary operation (represented as *)

And it satisfies these properties:
- Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of a * b is also in G
- Associativity: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
- Identity element: There is an element *e* such that for every element in G, the result of e * a = a * e = a (like multiplying by one)
- Inverse element: For every element, there is an inverse (i) such that a * i = e (identity element)

## Fields


# Intro Cryptography

## Hash Functions
- Takes an input and creates a digest
- Digest will have a fixed length
- Slight changes to input produce large changes to digest
- A one way function

## Symmetric Encryption
- Two people share a secret key
- Both use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data

## Asymmentric Encryption
- Each has a private / public key pair
- I already know this bit...
